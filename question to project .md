## Common Interview Questions and Answers

### General Project Questions

**Q: What motivated you to create FlightForge?**
A: I wanted to challenge myself by expanding on a familiar game concept with innovative features. The idea of integrating real-world weather data to affect gameplay mechanics seemed like an interesting way to create a dynamic experience that would be different each time someone played.

**Q: What were the biggest challenges you faced during development?**
A: The most challenging aspect was implementing the weather API integration and translating weather data into meaningful gameplay effects. Balancing the game's difficulty across different weather conditions and drone types also required extensive testing and fine-tuning.

**Q: How did you approach the design process?**
A: I started with a clear vision of the core gameplay loop, then incrementally added features, testing each addition thoroughly. I prioritized features based on their impact on the player experience, focusing first on the fundamental mechanics before adding more complex systems like power-ups and achievements.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the weather integration work in your game?**
A: The game makes an API call to open-meteo.com to fetch real-time weather data including temperature, wind speed, and weather codes. This data is then processed to modify game parameters like background colors, obstacle appearance, gravity effects, and wind forces. For example, high wind speeds create a horizontal force on the drone, while rain or snow is visualized through the particle system.

**Q: Can you explain how you implemented the different drone types?**
A: Each drone is defined by a set of physics properties stored in a dictionary. The key parameters are gravity (affecting fall speed) and flap strength (affecting upward momentum). When a player selects a drone, these properties are applied to the game physics. The Standard drone has balanced properties, the Heavy-Duty has higher gravity but stronger flaps, and the Agile has lower gravity with gentler flaps.

**Q: How does your collision detection system work?**
A: For obstacles, I use rectangle-based collision detection through Pygame's `Rect` class and its `colliderect()` method. For power-ups, I use distance-based collision detection by calculating the Euclidean distance between the drone's center and the power-up's center. The shield power-up adds complexity by allowing the player to survive one collision before being removed.

**Q: How did you implement the persistent high score system?**
A: The high score is stored in a simple text file. When the game starts, it attempts to read this file to load the previous high score. After each game over, if the current score exceeds the high score, the new value is written to the file. I included error handling to ensure the game functions properly even if the file operations fail.

**Q: What approach did you take for the power-up system?**
A: Power-ups are generated randomly during gameplay with a 20% chance when new obstacles appear. Each power-up has properties defining its type, visual appearance, and duration. When collected, they're added to an active power-ups dictionary with an expiration timestamp. The game continuously checks this dictionary to apply effects and remove expired power-ups.

### Python-Specific Questions

**Q: How did you structure your code to maintain readability and maintainability?**
A: I used object-oriented programming principles by encapsulating the game logic in a main `FlightForge` class. Methods are organized by functionality (drawing, physics, collision detection, etc.). I used descriptive variable names and added comments to explain complex logic. For data that needed to be accessed across different methods, I used class attributes rather than global variables.

**Q: How did you handle error cases, such as when the weather API is unavailable?**
A: I implemented a try-except block around the API call to catch any exceptions. If the API call fails, the game falls back to default weather values, ensuring the game remains playable even without internet connectivity. Similarly, for file operations like loading sounds or the high score, I check for file existence before attempting to access them.

**Q: What Pygame features did you find most useful for this project?**
A: Pygame's surface and drawing functions were essential for rendering the game elements. The built-in collision detection methods simplified obstacle interactions. The time management functions helped with frame rate control and power-up duration tracking. The event system made input handling straightforward, and the sound module provided easy audio integration.

### Problem-Solving Questions

**Q: How did you balance the difficulty of the game?**
A: Balancing was an iterative process involving playtesting and adjustments. I implemented a progressive difficulty system where obstacles become more complex as the score increases. The different drone types offer varying difficulty levels for players of different skill levels. Weather effects add unpredictability but are designed to be challenging without being frustrating.

**Q: How did you approach debugging during development?**
A: I used a combination of print statements to track variable values, visual debugging by rendering collision boundaries, and systematic testing of each feature in isolation. For complex issues, I would simplify the problem by temporarily disabling other features to identify the source of bugs.

**Q: If you had more time, what features would you add to the game?**
A: I'd enhance the visual polish with more animations and effects, add a tutorial system for new players, implement a more comprehensive progression system with unlockable content, and potentially add multiplayer functionality for competitive play. I'd also expand the weather effects to include more extreme conditions and their corresponding gameplay modifications.

### Reflection Questions

**Q: What did you learn from this project?**
A: This project deepened my understanding of game development principles, particularly in balancing complexity with playability. I improved my skills in API integration, game physics, and creating engaging user experiences. I also learned the importance of incremental development and thorough testing when building complex interactive systems.

**Q: How did you manage the project timeline and prioritize features?**
A: I used an agile-inspired approach, focusing first on creating a minimum viable product with the core gameplay loop. Once that was solid, I added features in order of their impact on the player experience, regularly testing to ensure each addition enhanced rather than detracted from the gameplay. Some planned features were deprioritized to ensure the core experience was polished.

**Q: What aspects of the project are you most proud of?**
A: I'm particularly proud of the weather integration system, as it creates a unique experience that connects the virtual game world to real-world conditions. The achievement system and power-ups add depth to what could otherwise be a simple game. From a technical perspective, I'm pleased with how the code structure maintains clarity despite the numerous interacting systems.
